          <p>
            Control your player with your mouse! <br /><br />
            1) The object of the game is to collect as many points as you can
            before you run out of lives, you can collect points by popping
            bubbles and from eating starfish! <br /><br />
            2) Stay away from sharks, they all spawn randomly on the upper 60%
            of the game on the right side, they swim sideways and all have a
            random to left speed, there is a 10% chance they will accelerate as
            well! <br /><br />
            2) You start off at a set size but will shrink down if you eat the
            stafish spawning from the top of the game until you reach your
            smallest size and then eating the starfish give you random points of
            6-10! <br /><br />
            3) Watch out for the Megladon! If you encounter it you will lose 2
            lives! He spawns every set interval at the bottom of the screen
            searching for food before returning to the depths of where he came
            from!
