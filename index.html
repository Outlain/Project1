           Control your player with your mouse! <br><br>
           1) The object of the game is to collect as many points as you can before you run out of lives, you can collect points by popping bubbles and from eating starfish! <br><br>
           2) Stay away from sharks, they all spawn randomly on the upper 60% of the game on the left side, they swim sideways and all have a random to left speed, there is a 10% chance they will accelerate as well! <br><br>
           2) You start off at a set size but will shrink down if you eat the stafish spawning from the top of the game until you reach your smallest size and then eating the starfish give you random points of 6-10! <br><br>
           3) Watch out for the Megladon! If you encounter it you will lose 2 lives! He spawns every set interval at the bottom of the screen searching for food before returning to the depths of where he came from!
